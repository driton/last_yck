General Notes 
################################################################################ 
Our idea is to create an app that would make our daily lives easier and more manageable. 
Considering that we are a young and developing country we are faced with constant 
difficulties throughout the day such as constant water reductions and irregular 
schedules of waste collection. In addition, to this we would also like to make Kosovo 
more attractive to all the visitors therefore we included another module which provides 
information to tourists about places to visit and things to do.
The project it's divided into 3 modules(3 teams): 

Modules 
################################################################################ 
1.Team Unstopbles- Water Reduction 

Considering the fact that there are constant water reductions in our country and in our city, 
we thought that it would be appropriate to know the exact schedule of these restrictions. 
If the citizens would know the exact time when these water restrictions would occur they 
would plan things beforehand. 
For instance, most of the people would like to wake up in the morning and take a shower 
before going to work or school, but in Kosovo you cannot do this since many times there 
is no water especially in the morning. If you want to go to the gym you cannot go when 
you personally want to, but you have to go during the time when you think there will be 
water when you come back home, and still you cannot be sure but have to guess the timing. 
There are many other instances where the citizens have to face with such problem because 
they are not informed when there will be water reductions. 
Water is important to the mechanics of the human body, if the citizens would be informed 
about these restrictions than at least they could fill up some containers and use them when 
needed. Having water reductions is a problem in itself let alone not knowing when these reductions will occur. 
Since we do not have sufficient water supply we thought it would be most necessary to 
develop a web/ mobile application that would fulfill the basic information available on 
the schedule of these reductions for entire Kosovo for the whole week, in every neighborhood. 
In addition, the citizens will have the opportunity to send complaints to a specific section 
where they will also be able to send their complaints and photos of irregularities detected. 


2.Team L-Coders( Recreational Activities)

The idea is to create a web/mobile app based on which the citizens and the tourists will be able to 
look for recreational places, for example see what the cinema is showing and its schedules all over Kosovo. 
Sports such as volleyball, basketball and such different games can serve as very good recreational 
activities, and with this app tourists can find where the best sports fields are located. 
Those with a brave heart take interest in activities like mountain biking, skiing, mountaineering, 
bungee jumping and similar other activities, and knowing that Kosovo has such beautiful and appropriate 
places this app would help in finding them. 
Recreational activities like singing, reading, listening to music, watching movies, dancing, aerobics or 
pursuit of hobbies, serve as the best means to recreate, and this application would aid the tourists in 
finding out when a movie is playing in which cinema, or what play in which theater.
All the above mentioned activities are present in Kosovo, but there is not an application or a website 
where people can log in and get the accurate information where these places are located, what they offer, 
or during what time is that particular event occurring. Kosovo is a small country but with beautiful 
places and great history, therefore by creating such an application it would be way easier for tourists 
to get to know the place and why not attract other visitors as well.
With this application the user will be able to select their city/place the category of their interest 
and view it in a map. By clicking on one of these spots more information on the specific place will appear. 

3. Team InnovaTeam

Another difficulty which the citizens of our capital are facing is the waste collection. We often see waste 
containers which are overloaded with waste at the entrances of buildings, in the neighborhoods, and 
all over the streets. These overloaded containers usually stay like that for quite some days and this 
then leads to very unpleasant odors. 
In addition to this the citizens are not aware of the exact time of waste collection and in certain 
neighborhoods they often cause delays in traffic. For instance, there are times when the truck comes 
early in the morning which causes problems for the people who have to go at work. There are other times 
when the truck comes late at night, and the sound of the truck does disturb the citizens. 
Sometimes the citizens get used to a particular time schedule but eventually it changes, so the waste 
stays outside in the garden for a long period which causes dogs or cats to come and go through it. 
This leads to the waste getting leaked all over and causing even more trouble for the citizens and 
as well for the waste collectors. 
Therefore this application will enable the citizens to exactly know the schedule of collection, and 
in addition it will allow each citizen to provide their feedback to the waste management office, 
and upload photos of areas where the waste has not been collected.
